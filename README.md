# Description

Software Engineering: Using an multi-paradigm programming language to develop a simple game. 
This is my final project submitted for Software Engineering Course offered by UBC at edx.

# Author

# Programming Language
- Racket (DrRacket)

# Objectives

1. The program file should be set to beginning student language and there should be no require declarations other than (require 2htdp/image) and (require 2htdp/universe).
2. The file should be neat and tidy, no tests or code should be commented out other than stubs and templates and all scratch work should be removed. 
3. All HtDW elements should be present, well formed, and have high internal quality. The file must include Constants, Data Definitions and Functions. The Constants section must be complete, there must be a main function that is correct and operates on a compound type. The main function must have all necessary big-bang options, and for each option, the handler must be present in the file. 
4. All elements of HtDF must be present and have high internal quality. This includes the Signature, Purpose, Stub, Examples/Tests, Template and the Function Body.
5. The program must be a working Space Invaders game, operating on the compound data definitions provided.
